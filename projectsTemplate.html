    <strong><h3>Usability Evaluation</h3></strong> Google Inbox, We conducted a formative evaluation for "Inbox's" website and mobile platform, followed by usability testing. We made use of semi-structured interviews, post-test questionnaires and heuristics to conduct the evaluation. This coupled with user think-aloud helped us glean information about the participantsâ€™ thought process.

        <strong><h3>Motivation</h3></strong>Inbox is a new application launched by Google on the existing Gmail platform. Motive behind Inbox is to provide users  with the capability to  effectively organize their mails rather than just been any other mailing application.  Enhanced features in Inbox include ability to snooze messages, group emails into "Bundles" , set reminders, highlights and much more.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong><h3>Workflow</h3></strong>
        We initiated our study to perform an expert review on the application. Internal Walkthrough in the form of expert review was followed by a Usability Test to study its effectiveness from user-centric design perspective. Usability Study Plan consisted of an introduction script, facilitator script, task list, post-task questionnarie, background questionnaire, informed consent form, System Usability Scale. Based on the findings from our internal walkthrough we designed the task list to address the painpoints in using the new features as well as testing the efficiency of basic features of a mailing application.

        <strong><h3>Testing Strategy : A/B Testing</h3></strong>
        We decided to conduct A/B testing comparing the desktop and mobile versions of the application. From our ethnographic studies and secondary research we learned that 65% of emails were opened on a smartphone or tablet. However from our interviews with users, they mentioned desktop been comfotable to use when it comes to a mailing application.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong><h3>Target Users</h3></strong>
        We mostly targeted the users who currently use some mailing application and are new to Inbox. We wanted to avoid power users to study the learning curve for the application.We specifically targetted students as they use mail account for their personal as well as university purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong><h3>Internal Walkthrough</h3></strong>
        Before goind ahead with the usability evaluation, we conducted internal walkthrough of Google Inbox using Cognitive Walkthrough and Heuristic Analysis to scope down our focus areas to evaluate. We used Jacob Neilson's 10 heuristics as guidelines through our hueristic evaluation. We also documented the findings into respective templates.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong><h3>Usability Test Plan</h3></strong>
        The test plan consisted of a Welcome Script, Task List, Facilitator Script, Informed Consent Form, System Usability Scale. Cognitive Walkthrough and Hueristic evaluation findings informed our tasks in the task list.
